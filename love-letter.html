        I'd like to start with just a simple I love you.  I call it simple but it's really not ... over the years that I've been developing it and experiencing it more, it has changed me as a person. When I first met you, love was something that always had a bad ending, everything I knew regarding it was really just miserable. As a result, I don't think I ever explored it at all, but you coming into my life changed that, it meant I had to know more about it and become better at loving someone and not base my definition of it on other people's experiences but my own. Coincidentally, it made me more confident, just knowing that I could love someone as much I love you gave me confidence ... and at the same time a sort of purpose. 
It made me understand the people around me better as well, I slowly began to understand things I'd always question growing up. I'd piece together why some people acted a certain way towards each other. Whether good or bad it was a special connection I'd see, but I'd never understand it.

        In a way I felt human, for the first time ever I felt like I could relate, that I could fit in. So what I wanna say is, thank you. Thank you for believing in me, thank you for not giving up on me, thank you for being there with me even when I pretended I didn't need anyone, thank you for showing me a whole new side of myself, thank you for  the memories that you've given me along the way. so I guess basically what I'm trying to say is simply that I love you. ❤
